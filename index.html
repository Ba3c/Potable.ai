        <h2>Our vision</h2>
        <p>
          Organizations are not able to leverage the power of AI, especially when they have to generate knowledge by integrating external and internal sources.
          This is because organizations want to protect their intellectual property and, hence, do not want to use LLMs that require them to share their data.
          Another challenge that is slowing the adoption of LLMs is the lack of determinism in the knowledge generated by general-purpose and vertical LLMs. 
          Potable solves these challenges by allowing organizations to build their own intelligent knowledge assistant. 
          The knowledge assistant is built on our proprietary Agentic LLM framework that constructs an immutable Knowledge Ledger hosted within the organization’s network. 
          With this proprietary framework, we are addressing the dual challenges of protecting the organization’s IP and generating deterministic knowledge.
